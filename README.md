Uses a fallback methodâ€”based on the [NLTK readability plugin][nltk] by
Thomas Jakobsen <thomj05@student.uia.no> and Thomas Skardal
<thomas04@student.uia.no>. This NLTK plugin is itself based on the
algorithm implemented in the [Lingua::EN::Syllable perl module][perl]
by Greg Fast <gdf@imsa.edu>.

Thanks to them for making their work available.

Requirements
------------

To use this Java library, you need Java 8 and Maven 3.

Installation
------------

With Maven, you can just add the following to the `dependencies`
section of your `pom.xml`:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>eu.crydee</groupId>
      <artifactId>syllable-counter</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

If you do not use maven, you can still [download][dl] the jar from
Maven Central and use it as appropriate.

Usage
-----

The usage is trivial. To retrieve the number of syllables of a word,
use the `count` method:

```java
import eu.crydee.syllablecounter.SyllableCounter;

...

SyllableCounter sc = new SyllableCounter();
int myCount = sc.count("facility");
// myCount holds 4
```

By default, the syllable counter doesn't cache words. You can modify
this behavior with the `setCacheSize` method. A positive value will
set a different upper limit while a negative value will let the cache
in its disabled state.
