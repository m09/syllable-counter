Syllable Counter
================

Uses a fallback method—based on the [NLTK readability plugin][nltk] by
Thomas Jakobsen <thomj05@student.uia.no> and Thomas Skardal
<thomas04@student.uia.no>. This NLTK plugin is itself based on the
algorithm implemented in the [Lingua::EN::Syllable perl module][perl]
by Greg Fast <gdf@imsa.edu>.

Thanks to them for making their work available.
